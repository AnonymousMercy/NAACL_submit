Protection from rain: The primary function of the umbrella hats is to keep their heads dry from the rain, which they do without requiring the use of hands, as regular umbrellas do.\\n\\n3. Visibility: The bright colors of the umbrella hat can increase visibility in the rain, which could be particularly useful in low-light or foggy conditions like the one in the image.\\n\\n4.
